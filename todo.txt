network configuration
    decaying learning rate
    use moving average for prediction
    change variance -> std deviation, need to restart for it to work
network
    increase depth of convnet to 7x7 filter output
    weight decay
-summary writing
    -training curve
    -save model periodically
distorting inputs
    based on color, hue, lighting
    cropping
    zooming
visualize
    visualize images by class
    visualize filters at each layer
    visualize output of poorly performing cells
refactor
    evaluation should be in a separate file
